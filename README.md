#Django persian translations
- the admin folder contains some translations on django-jet admin, which I suggest to use for commercial noncomplex admin needed projects.
- the shop folder contains some translations on common book store website.
* on wiki page I will write some tricks to work with django translations, but I suggest to check django`s documentation about this article:
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/i18n/translation/
